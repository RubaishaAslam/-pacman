The program will receive as input a file containing a list of names of image files, each corresponding to
an object. The objects will be rendered on a rectangular window and the user will move their objects around
using the keyboard. Objects cannot overlap, so your program will allow an object to move only when its
movement would not cause it to overlap with other objects or with the borders of the window.
We will provide code for reading the input files, for rendering the objects on the screen and for reading the
keyboard input. You will have to write code for storing the objects and for detecting overlaps between them.
